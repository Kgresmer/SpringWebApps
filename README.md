# SpringWebApps

These were all built when I was just learning Java and Spring and still in the bootcamp. 
Full stack web applications built with Java, JS, AJAX, JSON, JQuery, HTML/CSS, REST, Hibernate and MySQL.

VendingMachineV2 is the most in depth complete application. 
The others were used to repetition to practice and learn how to build certain functions, but VendingMachineV2 I started to experiment and build a much better application.
